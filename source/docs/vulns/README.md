# Introduction

## What?

Labs for exploiting common web vulnerabilities, like XSS and SQL injection, explanations of what causes them, how 
to exploit them, where to find them, and how to bypass protections.

## Why?

Perfect practice is what makes perfect. Susceptible applications and systems are great ways to test skill set in a 
virtual environment. This will also provide a basis for calculating contributions to the real world.

## How?
