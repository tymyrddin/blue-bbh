# Bug bounty platforms

| Pros                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Cons                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Transparency into a company’s process: disclosed<br>reports, metrics about the programs’ triage rates,<br>payout amounts, and response times.                                                                               | Triagers, third-party employees often not familiar<br>with all the security details about a company's<br>product, may handle reports improperly<br>(a common complaint)           |
| No worries about the logistics of emailing security<br>teams, following up on reports, and providing<br>payment and tax info every time you<br>submit a vulnerability report.                                               | Programs on platforms break the connection<br>between hackers and developers. With a direct<br>program, you can discuss the vulnerability<br>with a company’s security engineers. |
| They can step in to provide conflict resolution and<br>legal protection as a third party.                                                                                                                                   | If you submit a report to a non-platform program,<br>you have no recourse in the final bounty decision.                                                                           |
| You can’t always expect companies to pay up or<br>resolve reports in the current state of the industry.<br>The hacker-to-hacker feedback system that<br>platforms provide is helpful.                                       | You may get a T-shirt                                                                                                                                                             |
| Public programs on bug bounty platforms are often<br>crowded, because the platform gives them extra<br>exposure. Many privately hosted programs do not<br>get as much attention from hackers and are thus<br>less competitive. | And for the many companies that do not contract<br>with bug bounty platforms, you have no choice<br>but to go off platforms if you want<br>to participate in their programs.         |

Not either/or, both then.
