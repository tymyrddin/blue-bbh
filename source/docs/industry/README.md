# Introduction

## What?

Picking a Bug Bounty Program.

## Why?

Not too long ago, hacking and experimenting with web applications were illegal. But now, thanks to bug bounty programs, you can hack legally; companies set up bug bounty programs to reward security researchers for finding vulnerabilities in their applications.

There is a significant increase in the number of organisations with such programs, and it opens numerous opportunities for ethical hackers. Today, tons of programs exist, all with their unique characteristics, benefits, and drawbacks.
